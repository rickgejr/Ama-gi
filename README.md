Experimental CryptoNote

This is my experiment with CryptoNote.

My goal is to create a cryptocurrency with attributes as similar to gold as possilbe, but in the digital enviroment.

The currency should have these parameters:

1. Ease of use / plain language
2. Thin Blockchain
3. High Speed Transactions / Ease of exchange
4. No Premine
5. Lottery Based Mining approach - flat emission curve?
6. Open Mining - as many types of miners as possible
7. Be as imperishable as possible / blockchain proofs
8. Be rare - have a limited quantity with extememly slow discovery or quantity increases
9. Be tangilbe in the sense of there being an actual physical coin/bill, credit/debit card, smartphone app, computer app etc.
10. Tool of savings as much as possible. (Accomplished it two ways. Saving the physical coins or bills and/or holding the 'code.')
11. No set fees
12. Private: maintain CryptoNote Privacy Perimeters
